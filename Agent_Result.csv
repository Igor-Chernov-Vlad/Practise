To minimize the risk of aggravating your bees, it's recommended to quickly escape to a location where the bees cannot follow you. If this is not possible, standing still and allowing the bees to sting you quickly may be the best option. This approach reduces the risk of accidental harm to the bees, as each bee that stings successfully dies. Additionally, having a honey bottle on hand can help cure the sting damage.
